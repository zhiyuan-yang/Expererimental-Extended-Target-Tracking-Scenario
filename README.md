# Expererimental-Extended-Target-Tracking-Scenario
Recenetly article [1] has proposed a new extended target tracking(ETT) method considering the relationship between the number of measurements and the volume of extended target. Together with the new method, two experimental scenarios extracting from nuScenes dataset[2] have also been mentioned to test the peformance of the new method. This repo is the python implementation to extract the ETT test scenario from nuScenes dataset.
